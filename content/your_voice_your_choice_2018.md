## It's time to VOTE for your favorite park and street improvements! 

Voting for the 2018 Your Voice, Your Choice: Parks and Streets is now live and a proposal for improvements at Licton Springs Park (project 18-5001) is listed as one of the options for District 5! 

As part of the proposal, Seattle Parks and Recreation will repair the trails and bridges to make it easier for all people to move through Licton Springs Park and enjoy that natural area that is so close to where an increasing number of people are moving.
