It's officially spring time and with the warmer weather brings sunshine and blooming flowers. Did you know that Licton Springs has a [community p-patch](http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/programs-and-services/p-patch-community-gardening/p-patch-list/licton-springs) at College Way & North 92nd St?

# What is a P-Patch? 
P-Patch is the name given to community gardens that are managed by the Seattle P-Patch Community Gardening Program. The P-Patch program oversees 88 P-Patches over 32 acres throughout the city. Though a P-Patch, neighbors can come together to plan, plant, and grow community. 

# What is the history of Licton Spring's P-Patch? 
The Licton Springs P-Patch dates back to 1976 as a student-driven initiative at North Seattle College. While the original community garden ended up as a school parking lot, in 2013 the North Seattle College Sustainability Committee revived the initiative. After over a year of hard work from the community digging up land, building plots, and adding compost, a community garden of 67 plots and 15,000 sq ft was developed in Licton Springs! 

# How can I get involved? 
For information about volunteering, events, and general p-patch activities, email [lictonspringsppatch@gmail.com](mailto:lictonspringsppatch@gmail.com) or visit the community website at [www.lictonspringsppatch.wixsite.com/seattle](http://www.lictonspringsppatch.wixsite.com/seattle). The next community work party will be on Sunday, 4/15 from 11am to 1pm at the garden. The next leadership meeting will be on the first Wednesday of May (5/2) at 6pm at the OCEE building room 229 on North Seattle College campus.
