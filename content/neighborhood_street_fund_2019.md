## Help Prioritize Neighborhood Street Fund Projects
Community members have submitted over 300 projects for the [Neighborhood Street Fund](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/neighborhood-street-fund) and now it is time for community prioritization of the initiatives. Every vote has a huge impact at this stage of the process.

Please consider supporting some of the proposed Licton Springs projects:

* Improvements to help make Licton Springs more connected to Green Lake at N 85TH, including improving the [Wallingford Ave N crosswalk](https://nsf.consider.it/2019-114?results=true) (#2019-114) and the [Ashworth Ave N intersection](https://nsf.consider.it/2019-25?results=true) (#2019-25). These projects are listed as part of District 6 but would benefit both District 5 and District 6.
* Improvements to Aurora Ave N including [adding lighting](https://nsf.consider.it/2019-116?results=true) (#2019-116), [additional art installations](https://nsf.consider.it/2019-75?results=true) (#2019-75) and [crosswalk safety improvements](https://nsf.consider.it/2019-18?results=true) (#2019-18).
* A proposal to make [Stone Ave N](https://nsf.consider.it/2019-14?results=true) (#2019-14) a designated North / South Greenway providing safe pedestrian and bicycling access to schools, parks, and amenities.

You can find a map of all the submitted projects [here](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/neighborhood-street-fund/projects-map).

Upcoming Community Meetings:

* District 6 - Crown Hill Center, Tuesday, January 29, 7pm to 8:30pm
* District 5 - Broadview Branch Seattle Public Library, Thursday, January 31, 6pm to 7:30pm
* District 5 - Lake City Community Center, Tuesday, February 5th, 6:30pm to 8pm
* District 6 - Phinney Center Community Hall, Wednesday, February 13th, 6pm to 7:30pm

To provide feedback, rank projects proposed in your district online [here](https://nsf.consider.it/), or at a Community Prioritization Meeting in your district. The meetings will begin with a presentation of all the projects proposed in the hosting district. Then, you will receive a score card, where you can rank your top projects and submit to SDOT staff. Top-ranked projects will proceed to the voting phase in spring 2019.
