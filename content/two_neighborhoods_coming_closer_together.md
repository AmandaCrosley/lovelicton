Licton Springs is set to feel even more connected to Maple Leaf and the rest of the Northgate area. With the construction of a pedestrian bridge on 100th, you will never have to walk more than 5 minutes North or South to cross over I5 and into Maple Leaf. This bridge is set to complement the existing Northgate Way underpass, 92nd overpass, and nearby 80th overpass directly connecting Licton Springs to the Northgate Transit Station and upcoming light rail:

The bridge is proposed to be built on 100th at the north end of North Seattle College, giving it a straight path over to the transit center:

To find out more about the plans for the new pedestrian bridge you can read [Seattle's official overview of the project](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bridges-stairs-and-other-structures/bridges/northgate-pedestrian-and-bicycle-bridge).
There are also 3 upcoming opportunities to give feedback on the project before construction begins:

* [Mon. 3.19.18, 12-1:30 PM | North Seattle College, The Grove](https://www.facebook.com/events/443591789391586/)
* [Tues. 3.20.18, 8-9:30 AM | Aljoya Thornton Place](https://www.facebook.com/events/205339450220405/)

In related news, at the same time as the bridge will be under construction, it seems likely an improved Northgate will also be underway to welcome us upon completion:
