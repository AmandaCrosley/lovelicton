Hi Neighbors!

A friend of the blog reached out to us to let us know that this year's Halloween Walk is looking for volunteers:

> We are looking to recruit Friends of the Forest for this year's Licton Springs Halloween Walk - Do you or anyone you know like to dress up and give out treats? (The treats are provided.) Are your kids older and you miss seeing the young ones dressed up? Groups are welcome. You must be at least 12 years old to be a Friend or parents with children. Please contact Melanie at 206-227-9155 or email [melaniedavies81@gmail.com](mailto: melaniedavies81@gmail.com) if you can volunteer. The time commitment is from 4:15 to 6 pm. Hot cider provided.
