Thank you to everyone that came out across Licton Springs to meet with your neighbors and make 2018 another great success! Across the Licton Springs area, hundreds of neighbors got to know each other across over seven block parties.

Many community resources were shared at these block parties, including:

* [Smart 911](https://www.smart911.com/) - A way to add the information you want responders to know in case of an emergency before one happens.
* [Alert Seattle](http://alert.seattle.gov/) - The official emergency notification system used by the City of Seattle to communicate with city residents during emergencies.
* [Block Watch](https://www.seattle.gov/police/community-policing/block-watch) - Instructions on how to start an officially recognized neighborhood block watch.
* [Emergency Event Calendar](http://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/about-us/event-calendar/) - Upcoming events that teach crucial skills needed in the case of an emergency.
* [Emergency Hubs](https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/prepare/prepare-your-neighborhood/community-emergency-hubs) - A map of all the nearby emergency hubs to meet at after an emergency strikes.
* [Licton Springs Community Calendar](https://lovelicton.com/pages/community-calendar.html) - A shared calendar for all the events happening across the Licton Springs area.

Here's to hoping the community connections made at Night Out continue to grow over the next year!
