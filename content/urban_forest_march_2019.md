**This Saturday** be part of a community effort to restore a forgotten neighborhood greenspace! Trees for Seattle needs our help to continue their work with the community to reclaim our forgotten greenspace by spreading mulch and removing blackberry. The weather looks excellent for the event, but please don’t forget to wear long pants, sturdy shoes, and appropriate layers to keep you warm and dry. Make sure you bring your rain gear just in case - we will work rain or shine!

**When:** Saturday, March 23rd, 2019; 9:00am – 12:00pm

**Where:** Look for the event on the northeast corner of N 85th St and Meridian Ave N.

**What:** Blackberry removal, spreading mulch and freeing trees!

**Where to park/how to get there:** Near the bus stop for the 45, 355, and 994. There is street parking in the neighborhood where we are working, and Bishop Blanchet, the high school directly across the street, has generously opened their parking lot our volunteers, which can be accessed from 82nd Street. The school will also be hosting a sports event, so there may be limited spots. Please use the crosswalk at 85th and Wallingford to safely cross 85th Street. Trees for Seattle should be easy to spot - the group with hot coffee and lots of shovels!

At the event, there will be coffee, water, light snacks, tools, gloves and instructions for everyone.

Together we can improve our neighborhood greenspace!
