> UPDATE: The meeting was originally set to start at 7 PM but was then changed to a 6 PM start time by Seattle Parks and Recreation.

Join other members of the community on May 1st, 6:00PM-8:30PM, to help shape the future of Mineral Springs park!
The meeting will be open to the general public, so whether you live near the park or frequent it for disk golf, this is an
important meeting to attend.
