An anonymous reader of LoveLicton let us know about a celebrity living right here in Licton Springs:

The “tuxedo” cat, Henry, known by his stage name, Henri, Le Chat Noir, is a resident of our
neighborhood, though he lives in quiet obscurity, not troubled by his You-Tube fame. He plays the role
of a depressed, French cat in a series of videos that have garnered millions of viewers. Henry has over
170,000 Facebook followers and has been featured on Animal Planet and in People magazine. Henry also
has two books out on his philosophy and a Wikipedia page. But no French Riviera for this feline! “I love
Licton”, says Henry, “it’s the best place in the world for a spoiled, handsome cat.”
