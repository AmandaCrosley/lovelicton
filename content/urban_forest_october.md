Yesterday morning several neighbors came together at 85th and Meridian to clear away invasive weeds (looking at you blackberries!) and make way for an urban forest.

The work party was the second such event at the site and made significant progress:

Planting trees in the area, which borders an I5 off-ramp, will have a large positive impact on the neighborhood as highways and their ramps are a major source of pollution and noise. Trees have been shown to [reduce highway noise](https://www.healthguidance.org/entry/8525/1/Trees-And-Shrubs-Can-Curb-Noise.html) while [cutting pollution by half](https://www.fastcompany.com/3022137/dont-like-pollution-in-your-home-plant-a-row-of-trees-and-breath-easier-by-half). The trees will work in tandem with the noise wall put in place in 2009 along I5 itself, to make Licton Springs a quieter and healthier neighborhood for all of us.

Hope to see you at the next work party!
