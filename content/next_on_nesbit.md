Nesbit Ave N. between N 85TH and N 90TH street has seen more than its fair share of change and disruption over the last few years.
A tiny house village opened on the street 2 years ago, while reports indicated that crime was concentrating in the area.
Then, after months of escalating tensions, [a homeless man was shot and killed on Nesbit](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/prosecutors-suspect-became-fixated-on-homeless-man-before-fatal-seattle-shooting/). While all of this was occurring, a large seemingly abandoned lot, and 2 large construction projects left few eyes on the street.

This led [Seattle Neighborhood Group](https://www.sngi.org/welcome/index.php) to create a Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design [(CPTED) report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByAPPfoZcdyXRTJIb0hhMUF4aWpQN2VVMUpIb24wblpKeHR3/view?usp=sharing) on the 8800th block of Nesbit at the end of 2017, and then survey neighbors about the area last year.

Since then, the tiny house village has announced its permanent closure, to be replaced with a 112 unit affordable housing project built by [LIHI](https://lihi.org/):

On the street, branches have been trimmed, new lights installed to improve visibility, and sharps containers planned. And of course, construction projects are getting closer to completion:

Seattle Neighborhood Group wants to keep this momentum going, and is hosting a community meeting to discuss the survey and improvements this Thursday:

The meeting will be held at the nearby Cascadia Elementary School, January 17th, 6-7:30 PM.
Hopefully, as neighbors, we can impact the future of Nesbit together.
