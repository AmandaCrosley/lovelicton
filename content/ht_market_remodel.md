Following the remodel that occurred at the next door cinema a few years back, HT Market is now also being remodeled.
Once the remodel is complete, around 1/4 of the market will be dedicated to Real Plaza Latina, which will provide Latin groceries, baked goods, and a deli.

A Mediterranean section is also being added to HT, helping transform it into a truly international market.

Finally, Fun DJ appears to have closed, and is set to be replaced by a new dumpling restaurant:

All of this, while Pilgrim Coffeehouse continues expanding its presence in the plaza, now open 5 days a week:

With one of Seattle's most comfortable theaters, a truly international market, phenomenal inexpensive teriyaki, and a local coffee roaster: Oak Tree is becoming not only a great community resource but a place worth the stop.
