A friend of the blog lent us a historical pamphlet from when Licton Springs was first being developed that I thought was too cool not to share.

While many things have changed since this pamphlet initially went out, we still firmly believe that Licton Springs is a great neighborhood to join and be a part of.
Additionally, we still have [Licton Springs Park](/an-early-preview-of-spring-in-licton-springs.html) and [Licton Springs Garden (reborn as a P-Patch)](/licton-springs-ppatch-2018.html): as seen on our [Map of the Neighborhood](/pages/map-of-the-neighborhood.html).

Let's keep investing in the future of Licton Springs!
