**Call to Action:** We hope you will join us and [vote to improve the Wallingford Ave N. and N. 85TH intersection](https://nsf.consider.it/2019-114?results=true).
Even though Licton Springs is in District 5, this intersection project is listed on District 6 due to being on the border. You can vote to improve this intersection, independent of what District you may live in - doing so will not compete with other District 5 projects. Projects move forward or not based on just a handful of votes - every vote has a huge impact.

Do you cross N 85th to make your way to Green Lake? Do you ever feel like you are competing with turning cars, still rushing at high speeds off the highway? Do you ever get stuck, forced to wait for the second cycle of intersection lights, because they seemingly prioritize everything but pedestrians? Are you barely able to make it across in the time given? You are not alone.

It's time we make the N 85TH and Wallingford Ave N. intersection safe and accessible for all. During this round of Neighborhood Street Funding, we have the opportunity to improve the intersection and ensure it's safe for pedestrians while strengthening our connection to Green Lake. The intersection connects no fewer than 5 schools, is the most utilized connection between Licton Springs and Green Lake, and is utilized by people of all ages and abilities. However, due to people coming off the highway immediately before the intersection and then turning at the same point pedestrians are set to walk - it has a dangerous history - leading to many pedestrian-involved accidents. Even without the dangers from turning cars, it has too short of a pedestrian cycle, for anyone but the able-bodied to make it across in time.

Every day, roughly 39 thousand cars - or almost as many as travel along Aurora, make their way to the intersection. Over 12,000 of the cars are turning onto or off of the I5 on-ramp, leading to dangerous interactions with pedestrians.

[![Schools](/images/nsf/wallingford_and_85th/schools.jpg)](/images/nsf/wallingford_and_85th/schools.jpg)

The intersection connects 5 schools, one of which - Bishop Blanchet - is placed directly at the intersection. This puts kids at great danger of witnessing or being involved in a vehicle-pedestrian accident.

And while, there has been positive work proposed to improve the Ashworth connection, which could be a good alternative for bikers, it is simply too inconvenient for pedestrians. The Wallingford route has few additional intersections once N 85TH is crossed, leads immediately to the centre of North Green Lake business district, and is simply a much shorter and simpler walk for most destinations. Few, if any, of the residents in the east half of Licton Springs, would be willing to increase their walking distance to Green Lake by so much. Not to mention the schools in question abut Wallingford Ave N. Making it the most likely route for students to use.

The importance behind improving the N 85TH intersection goes beyond the intersection itself representing the first step to making the entire Wallingford Ave N route safe.
In 2017 alone, there were 4 pedestrian accidents along this route, including one at the N 85TH intersection, and one death at N 82ND. Doubtlessly, there were many more minor or near misses that went unreported.

[This](https://nsf.consider.it/2019-114?results=true) is our opportunity to start making Vision Zero a reality for Wallingford Ave N.
