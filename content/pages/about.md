Welcome to our blog! We created LoveLicton as a community resource to cover news, retail openings, and events happening in the beautiful Licton Springs neighbourhood and surrounding areas of Seattle. Licton Springs, located between I5 and Aurora Ave., is uniquely well connected to the rest of Seattle, while also having many amenities of its own. Living in Licton Springs means walkable access to the Licton Springs Park, the Oak Tree Plaza, the Green Lake Park, the Greenwood Strip, the Maple Leaf Strip, and the Northgate Mall. If you find yourself in the Licton Springs area, as a neighbour or just passing through, we hope you find some inspiration for how to enjoy your time by reading this blog!
