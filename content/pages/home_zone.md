The southeastern corner of Licton Springs has been chosen by Seattle Neighborhood Greenways for a Home Zone pilot!
Home Zones represent an innovative and inexpensive approach to increasing walkability, safety, and the sense of community in neighborhoods that lack full sidewalk coverage.
This area was chosen, in particular, because it represents a small well defined area in which to prove out the concept.

This pilot is meant to:

1. Increase walkability and pedestrian activity
2. Reduce amount and/or speed of cut through traffic with street signs, greenery, and speed bumps
3. Bring the community together around art installation(s)

The pilot covers, and is looking for input from, the area north of 85th, south of 92nd, west of I5 and east of Wallingford Ave. N.
Below is a map of the area, as well as some of the ideas that have been proposed for the pilot:

The following have been presented so far as ways to achieve this vision:

1. Traffic calming and reduction measures on Meridian Ave N (Consisting of Do Not Enter, Local Access Only Signs, Stop Signs, and planters)

2. A wayfinding and walking distance sign (current recommendation at N 92nd and Wallingford Ave N).

3. A combination cross walk / speed bump at 90th and Burke Ave N, to decrease speed coming down the hill
4. A Local Access Only sign at Corliss Ave N
5. Public Street/Intersection art (Location TBD, one possibility is N 88th and Burke Ave N
