Thank you to everyone that came out Saturday and helped make Licton Spring's holiday a little brighter! Whether you helped put lights up at Licton Springs park or made crafts and enjoyed music with us at Mineral Springs Park, you are part of what makes this neighborhood such a great place to call home. Here are some of our favorite memories from this year's holiday events:
