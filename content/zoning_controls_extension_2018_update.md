Today Seattle's Planning, Land Use, and Zoning Committee adopted a 6 Month extension on new non-pedestrian-oriented developments within the Aurora Licton Urban Village:

This leaves the final fate of the extension to Seattle City Council with a vote coming up this following Monday (the 24th of September).
If you have thoughts on the extension and have not yet made them heard, this represents your final opportunity, and I encourage you to follow the steps [ALUV has outlined](http://auroralictonuv.org/2018/08/28/interim-controls-extension/) to contact your representatives.

The committee's adoption of the ordinance followed significant feedback from our local community during their September 5 meeting:

In the meantime, as of Monday, the only Coffee shop within the Urban Village has now closed:

And just a few blocks North, the first new proposed residential apartment project in some time is actively [gathering feedback](https://designreview.info/) up till the 26th of this month.
