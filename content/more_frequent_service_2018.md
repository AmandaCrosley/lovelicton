[Starting this September the frequency of the E Line, in addition to many other regional bus lines, will be increased](https://www.kingcounty.gov/elected/executive/constantine/news/release/2018/July/25-metro-service-amazon-seattle.aspx). This change is happening thanks to a partnership between Amazon, the City of Seattle, and King County Metro. This will be a particularly welcome addition over the next few years as the [recent closure of the Convention Place Station](https://komonews.com/news/local/metros-convention-place-station-closing-saturday-for-good) reroutes our other popular bus line into downtown: the 41 - leading to possible delays until the light rail construction is complete.

This change will positively affect many as the E Line is Metroâ€™s highest-ridership route with more than 17,000 weekday riders.
