We've just been given news we couldn't be happier to report:

Pilgrim Coffee is coming to Oak Tree plaza!

Starting tomorrow Pilgrim Coffee will be operating at 10002 Aurora Ave N Monday - Wednesday 7-10 AM, and we've heard rumors that if demand is high enough they may expand their hours next month.

It's been a little less than two months since [Starbucks left Licton Spring's urban village](https://lovelicton.com/original_north_seattle_starbucks_closing.html), leaving the area without any coffee options.
Tomorrow that all changes. While many would have been content with almost any Coffee Shop setting up at the location, we couldn't be more ecstatic that our favorite Coffee Truck
is setting up right in front of the old Starbucks. We've been a fan of Pilgrim Coffee for a while, as they've roasted some great coffee right here in the neighborhood:

It also doesn't hurt that the opening happens at the perfect time for holiday-inspired drinks:

We hope you will join us drinking some great local coffee!
