Hi Neighbors!

We wanted to share with you some of the holiday cheer we saw on display around Licton Springs.

Many houses in the neighborhood have impressive light displays:

Businesses along North Aurora (Nora) are also lit up nicely this year as icicles line the business fronts:

In nearby Greenwood, the tradition of placing playful monkeys in business windows for zoo lights continues:

Over in Olympic Manor, it appears more houses are decorated than are not:

Finally, in Maple Leaf we enjoyed seeing this light display in-sync with music:
