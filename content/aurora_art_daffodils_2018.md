If you are as excited about the ongoing art project on the Aurora Pedestrian Bridge [as we are](https://lovelicton.com/vibrant-art-aurora-2018.html), you will be thrilled to hear there is now an opportunity to meet neighbors and help enhance the project!
This coming weekend (Saturday the 17th and Sunday the 18th), neighbors will be meeting 10:00am-4:00pm to prepare the soil and then plant over 3 thousand daffodil bulbs.

You can find out more on [ALUV's website](http://auroralictonuv.org/2018/11/11/community-planting-project-nov-17th-18th/?fbclid=IwAR21ZzkUQRsPudMdVgRaOGrYX40KfUZhe6_Ew9HjS9ALPP1xlt_xyhRbfhg), who first alerted us to this community project.

Hope to see you there!
