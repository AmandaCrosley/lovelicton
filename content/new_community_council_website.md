For the last month work has been going on behind the scenes to refresh the Licton Springs Community Council Website,
and I'm excited to say this new site is ready to be unveiled! You can now visit the brand new website at [lictonsprings.org](https://lictonsprings.org).

The community council has been the force behind improving Licton Springs and giving everyone in the community a voice for more than two decades.
This new website is part of a broader push to introduce the council to a whole new generation so that their great work can include a
broader audience and have even more impact.

We have also added in our menu a permanent link directly to the community council and from the community councils website a permanent link to the blog.
As part of this partnership [lovelicton.com](lovelicton.com) will continue to be the place to go to get a pulse on the community and read about the positive changes going on
and [lictonsprings.org](lictonsprings.org) will be the place to join your neighbors and *make* more of those positive changes happen.

As a reminder: the Licton Springs Community Council will have a booth at the (Live in D5!)[https://www.facebook.com/events/1999117153465269/] event that is happening *today* 1-4PM at Hubbart Homestead Park.
It's a great opportunity to get introduced to the council as well as many other nearby community groups, while enjoying:

* 3 local bands
* Free salmon and fry bread sponsored by the United Indians of All Tribes
* A baby goat petting zoo
