Being able to easily walk between BevMo! and Total Wine in the same trip was a magical thing for anyone who anxiously awaited limited availability beer, wine, or spirit releases.
Of course, one-day several months ago, this duo came to an end, leaving only Total Wine - which sits at the bottom of an apartment complex, left in-tact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of the blog recently reached out to us, with an unsurprising explanation for that closure: BevMo!, which was nestled into an old-fashioned shopping strip, needed to close to make way for the expansion of Downtown Northgate. In the place of the old shopping plaza, plans are in place to build a 235 unit apartment building with retail at the bottom, continuing the trend happening around the old plaza:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/downtown_northgate/bevmo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Old BevMo! Location" src="/images/downtown_northgate/bevmo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="/images/downtown_northgate/crane.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Construction Around the Building" src="/images/downtown_northgate/crane.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="/images/downtown_northgate/alley.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alleyway showing grouping of mid-rises" src="/images/downtown_northgate/alley.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to give your input into the design of this new apartment building, there is an upcoming opportunity to contribute to the early design guidance &lt;a href="http://www.seattle.gov/DPD/aboutus/news/events/DesignReview/Detail/default.aspx?id=6936"&gt;August 6, 2018 6:30 pm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the redevelopment of the mall into the focal point of this new downtown area continues being planned, with the first two opportunities for community input coming tentatively next month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.seattle.gov/DPD/aboutus/news/events/DesignReview/Detail/default.aspx?id=6930"&gt;August 13, 2018 6:30 pm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.seattle.gov/DPD/aboutus/news/events/DesignReview/Detail/default.aspx?id=6931"&gt;August 27, 2018 6:30 pm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transit-oriented development, temporarily paused, has come back in full swing with a new RFP based on free land from King County and an upzone to allow up to 24 story buildings &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/king-county-moves-to-allow-affordable-housing-at-future-northgate-light-rail-station/"&gt;promised by the end of this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, concerns over future of the Northgate Pedestrian bridge which will connect Licton Springs directly to both the developing Light Rail and Downtown Northgate, have been alleviated after the &lt;a href="https://cascade.org/blog/2018/06/bridge-92-northgate-biking-and-walking-bridge-moving-forward"&gt;Seattle Colleges Board of Trustees conditionally agreed to give an easement to the new bridge&lt;/a&gt;. The latest plans for which, will have the new bridge/path only a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/47.7015386,-122.3422173/47.7014736,-122.335324/@47.7008021,-122.3419329,16z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e2"&gt;~5-10 minute walk away from Oak Tree Plaza&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/downtown_northgate/bridge.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="New Bridge" src="/images/downtown_northgate/bridge.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how you feel about the developments overall, hopefully, this all will lead to a North Seattle that feels more connected both to Downtown Seattle and to the neighborhoods contained within.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Transportation"></category><category term="Pedestrian"></category><category term="Construction"></category></entry><entry><title>This small Seattle neighborhood is experiencing big changes.</title><link href="/more-improvements-coming.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-05T01:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-04-05T01:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>timothycrosley</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-04-05:/more-improvements-coming.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Licton Springs is looking to become even more well prepared for the urban demands of being a &amp;lt; 14 minute light rail ride from downtown.

It already has relatively high side-walk coverage and population density for the North Seattle area. It is also full of pro-growth and housing community groups - with no noticeable Nimby presence. And, with the light rail approaching in a few more years, it appears the community will be well positioned to take on the growth it desires. The neighbourhood has been seeing additional improvements planned and completed at an unprecedented pace. It's hard just to keep track of all the projects going on! To try and make it a bit easier: I've gone ahead and taken inventory of all the projects I'm aware of and mapped them out by location, start time, and end time.&lt;/p&gt;

In any case, we certainly have an exciting few years to look forward to! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Improvements"></category><category term="Transit"></category><category term="School"></category></entry><entry><title>Hidden in urban Seattle a nearly 100 year old duck oasis lives on</title><link href="/pillings-pond.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-25T01:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-03-25T01:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>timothycrosley</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-03-25:/pillings-pond.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the weather gets nicer - if you find yourself wanting to see some ducks you may think the best place to do so would be Green Lake or one of Seattle's many parks.

However, the best place to catch a glimpse of the local duck population in Seattle is right here in Licton Springs. Located on N 90th St between Densmore and Ashworth Ave N and near the new school: Pilling's Pond remains as a reminder of Chuck Pilling's legacy. This is the spot where he became the first successful breeder of the hooded merganser, bufflehead and harlequin ducks. Here you can still find hundreds of ducks enjoying the pond. While there has been some concern about the future of the pond due to a sale, the new owners have expressed their desire to keep the legacy going and have allowed Dave Kunkle to continue the maintenance of this great North Seattle landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: You can't enter the pond but can safely view the ducks from behind the wired fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college has expressed approval with the new design alleviating concerns that disagreements would lead to no bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new design decreases costs and the maximum slope while improving visibility and addressing the concerns of North Seattle College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has secured all necessary funding contingent on it being complete before the light rail opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take 10-15 minutes to walk from the base of the bridge to the entrance of the transit center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge will incorporate scenic overlooks and art installation(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no bike/pedestrian or direction lane separation planned for the bridge. Instead, users will be expected to utilize the generously wide (16ft) path to follow standard right of way rules. Additionally, visual and tactile cues will be added near mixing areas, transition zones, and overlooks providing helpful cues to bicyclists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIA Architecture expressed pride in their work to create an affordable design that will still be an enjoyable experience to walk over, highlight the beauty inherit on both sides of I5, and act as another North Seattle landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking with Eric from VIA Architecture, I learned that they use VR to verify what a realistic experience of their designs will be once built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned about a ton of other exciting things planned for Licton Springs and the surrounding area that will be rolling out over the next few years. Expect a follow-up post with a full overview of all these changes and when we can expect them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Transportation"></category><category term="Pedestrian"></category></entry><entry><title>A new bridge is set to bring two Seattle neighbourhoods closer together</title><link href="/pedestrian-bridge-updates.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-14T07:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-03-14T07:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>timothycrosley</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-03-14:/pedestrian-bridge-updates.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Licton Springs is set to feel even more connected to Maple Leaf and the rest of the Northgate area.

With the construction of a pedestrian bridge on 100th, you will never have to walk more than 5 minutes North or South to cross over I5 and into Maple Leaf. This bridge is set to complement the existing Northgate Way underpass, 92nd overpass, and nearby 80th overpass directly connecting Licton Springs to the Northgate Transit Station and upcoming light rail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/bridge/i5_routes.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Existing routes over I5" src="/images/bridge/i5_routes.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge is proposed to be built at the north end of North Seattle College, giving it a straight path over to the transit center:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/bridge/100th.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Proposed location" src="/images/bridge/100th.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

There are also 3 upcoming opportunities to give feedback on the project before construction begins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Wed. 3.21.18, 5-6:30 PM | Neighborcare Health at Meridian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In related news, at the same time as the bridge will be under construction, it seems likely an improved Northgate Mall will also be underway to welcome us upon completion:&lt;/p&gt;
