                <p>An anonymous reader of LoveLicton let us know about a celebrity living right here in Licton Springs:</p>
<p>The “tuxedo” cat, Henry, known by his stage name, Henri, Le Chat Noir, is a resident of our
neighborhood, though he lives in quiet obscurity, not troubled by his You-Tube fame. He plays the role
of a depressed, French cat in a series of videos that have garnered millions of viewers. Henry has over
170,000 Facebook followers and has been featured on Animal Planet and in People magazine. Henry also
has two books out on his philosophy and a Wikipedia page. But no French Riviera for this feline! “I love
Licton”, says Henry, “it’s the best place in the world for a spoiled, handsome cat.”</p>

                <p>A friend of the blog dropped a hint letting us know that a new traffic circle has been outlined for N 97th and Wallingford Ave N, which SDOT plans on having completed this summer! The circle will be a very welcome addition to the area, as, despite lots of warning signs and kids, sees more than its fair share of speeding.</p>
<p><a href="images/street_improvements/signs.jpg"><img alt="Warning Signs" src="images/street_improvements/signs.jpg"></a>

<a href="images/street_improvements/circle.jpg"><img alt="Location of new Circle" src="images/street_improvements/circle.jpg"></a></p>
<p>This new circle will complement the existing one at N 95th, hopefully reducing speed driving up Wallingford.</p>
<p><a href="images/street_improvements/circle.jpg"><img alt="95th Circle" src="images/street_improvements/95th.jpg"></a></p>
<p>On my walk up to N 97th, I also noticed initials outlines for a continuation of the N 92nd bike path by the new School.</p>

<p>You can find out about some more street improvements scheduled to be completed this year on <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/greenways-program/north-seattle">SDOT's Greenway &amp; School Safety Project Website</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy this great weather! And hopefully, as the season progresses, we will all be able to enjoy some safer streets!</p>

                <p>Right to the northwest of Licton Springs park at the Seattle City Light North Service Center lies a beautiful art piece by Merrily Tompkins.
The art not only serves as a sign of nicer weather, as flowers bloom from Tesla's head but also serves as a great reminder that technology and
nature can coexist in harmony. In a way, it's the perfect Seattle art piece, a city nestled in some of the most profoundly beautiful natural
environments while leading the way in our technological future.</p>

                <p>Serving up delicious Latin Cuisine right on Aurora Avenue, Tropicos Breeze has long been one of Licton Spring's most beloved restaurants. So, when I was told the Licton Springs location had closed, I feared the worse.</p>
<p><a href="images/tropicos/patio.jpg"><img alt="El Patio Entrance" src="images/tropicos/patio.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Rushing to the restaurant after work, I was greeted not by Tropicos Breeze, but by El Patio. What a quick transformation! Entering El Patio, I saw familiar faces and after talking to the staff learned what had taken place. The Licton Spring's Tropicos Breeze location was sold to the owner's cousin. The new restaurant, I was told, retains the same staff and great quality food we have come to love. </p>
<p><a href="images/tropicos/patio_2.jpg"><img alt="El Patio Patio" src="images/tropicos/patio_2.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I ordered Pollo en Crema and Horchata - two of my favorite standbys from the old Tropicos Breeze. You know, just to make sure I was told the truth...
And I can happily confirm: the food here is as tasty as ever!</p>

                <p>It's officially spring time and with the warmer weather brings sunshine and blooming flowers. Did you know that Licton Springs has a <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/programs-and-services/p-patch-community-gardening/p-patch-list/licton-springs">community p-patch</a> at College Way &amp; North 92nd St?</p>
<h1>What is a P-Patch?</h1>
<p>P-Patch is the name given to community gardens that are managed by the Seattle P-Patch Community Gardening Program. The P-Patch program oversees 88 P-Patches over 32 acres throughout the city. Though a P-Patch, neighbors can come together to plan, plant, and grow community. </p>
<h1>What is the history of Licton Spring's P-Patch?</h1>
<p>The Licton Springs P-Patch dates back to 1976 as a student-driven initiative at North Seattle College. While the original community garden ended up as a school parking lot, in 2013 the North Seattle College Sustainability Committee revived the initiative. After over a year of hard work from the community digging up land, building plots, and adding compost, a community garden of 67 plots and 15,000 sq ft was developed in Licton Springs! </p>
<h1>How can I get involved?</h1>
<p>For information about volunteering, events, and general p-patch activities, email <a href="mailto:lictonspringsppatch@gmail.com">lictonspringsppatch@gmail.com</a> or visit the community website at <a href="http://www.lictonspringsppatch.wixsite.com/seattle">www.lictonspringsppatch.wixsite.com/seattle</a>. The next community work party will be on Sunday, 4/15 from 11am to 1pm at the garden. The next leadership meeting will be on the first Wednesday of May (5/2) at 6pm at the OCEE building room 229 on North Seattle College campus. </p>

                <p>Licton Springs is looking to become even more well prepared for the urban demands of being a &lt; 14 minute light rail ride from downtown. It already has relatively high side-walk coverage and population density for the North Seattle area. It is also full of pro-growth and housing community groups - with no noticeable Nimby presence. And, with the light rail approaching in a few more years, it appears the community will be well positioned to take on the growth it desires. The neighbourhood has been seeing additional improvements planned and completed at an unprecedented pace. It's hard just to keep track of all the projects going on! To try and make it a bit easier: I've gone ahead and taken inventory of all the projects I'm aware of and mapped them out by location, start time, and end time.</p>

<p>Did I miss anything? If so, please let me know in a comment below.
In any case, we certainly have an exciting few years to look forward to! </p>

                <p>As the weather gets nicer - if you find yourself wanting to see some ducks you may think the best place to do so would be Green Lake or one of Seattle's many parks. However, the best place to catch a glimpse of the local duck population in Seattle is right here in Licton Springs. Located on N 90th St between Densmore and Ashworth Ave N and near the new school: Pilling's Pond remains as a reminder of Chuck Pilling's legacy. This is the spot where he became the first successful breeder of the hooded merganser, bufflehead and harlequin ducks. Here you can still find hundreds of ducks enjoying the pond. While there has been some concern about the future of the pond due to a sale, the new owners have expressed their desire to keep the legacy going and have allowed Dave Kunkle to continue the maintenance of this great North Seattle landmark.</p>
<p>NOTE: You can't enter the pond but can safely view the ducks from behind the wired fence.</p>

                <p>I was able to make it to yesterday's meeting at Neighborcare Health to discuss the development of the new pedestrian bridge and wanted to share my main takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The college has expressed approval with the new design alleviating concerns that disagreements would lead to no bridge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new design decreases costs and the maximum slope while improving visibility and addressing the concerns of North Seattle College.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project has secured all necessary funding contingent on it being complete before the light rail opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will take 10-15 minutes to walk from the base of the bridge to the entrance of the transit center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bridge will incorporate scenic overlooks and art installation(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no bike/pedestrian or direction lane separation planned for the bridge. Instead, users will be expected to utilize the generously wide (16ft) path to follow standard right of way rules. Additionally, visual and tactile cues will be added near mixing areas, transition zones, and overlooks providing helpful cues to bicyclists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VIA Architecture expressed pride in their work to create an affordable design that will still be an enjoyable experience to walk over, highlight the beauty inherit on both sides of I5, and act as another North Seattle landmark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talking with Eric from VIA Architecture, I learned that they use VR to verify what a realistic experience of their designs will be once built.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also learned about a ton of other exciting things planned for Licton Springs and the surrounding area that will be rolling out over the next few years. Expect a follow-up post with a full overview of all these changes and when we can expect them.</p>
